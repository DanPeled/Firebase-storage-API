# Firebase Storage and Authentication Example

This is a simple web application that demonstrates how to integrate Firebase Storage and Authentication for user file uploads and authentication.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

1. [Firebase Account](https://firebase.google.com/): You need to create a Firebase project to get the required configuration details.
2. Firebase Web SDK: You can include Firebase using script tags in your HTML or use a module bundler like Webpack or Rollup.
   - [Firebase Script Tags](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#script-tags)
   - [NPM Installation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase)

## Project Setup

1. Clone this repository or create a new HTML file and copy the JavaScript code provided in your project.

2. Replace the `YOUR_API_KEY`, `YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN`, `YOUR_PROJECT_ID`, `YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET`, `YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`, `YOUR_APP_ID`, and `YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID` in the `firebaseConfig` object with your Firebase project's configuration values. You can find these values in your Firebase project settings.

3. Initialize Firebase and Firebase Storage:

```javascript
import { initializeApp } from "https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.4.0/firebase-app.js";
import { getStorage } from "https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.4.0/firebase-storage.js";
import { getAuth, onAuthStateChanged, createUserWithEmailAndPassword, signInWithEmailAndPassword, signOut } from "https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.4.0/firebase-auth.js";

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const storage = getStorage(app);
const auth = getAuth(app);
```

Create folders in Firebase Storage for different file types. In the provided code, different file extensions are mapped to folders. Adjust the folders object to your requirements.

Configure your HTML structure with the necessary elements. You can refer to the provided code for element IDs and how they are used.

Implement event listeners for user registration, login, and file uploads.

Deploy your application to a web server or hosting service. Make sure to configure your Firebase project's authentication settings to allow your app's domain.

Access your web app and start using Firebase Storage and Authentication!

# Usage
Users can register or log in using the registration and login forms.

After successful authentication, users can upload files. Images are displayed as images, and other file types are shown as clickable links.

Clicking on an image or file link will open the file in a new tab or window.

Users can also log out using the "Logout" button.
